## Description
The foundational work for the AgriTech API was completed. This included setting up the Express.js server, establishing the Mongoose connection to MongoDB, and creating the core application structure. Additionally, Docker support was added via a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to ensure a consistent development environment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The server starts successfully using `npm start`.
- A health check endpoint at `/status` returns a `200 OK` response.
- The application can be launched using `docker-compose up`.

## Definition of Done
The base server is running, connects to the database, and the Docker environment is fully functional for local development.
