## Description
An authentication system was implemented for the API. It uses a phone number and a mock OTP for initial sign-up/login. Upon successful verification, the system issues JWT access and refresh tokens for securing subsequent API calls. A middleware was also created to protect routes and check user roles.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A user can request an OTP via `/auth/request-otp`.
- A user can verify the OTP via `/auth/verify-otp` to receive JWTs.
- Protected routes return a 401 error if no valid token is provided.

## Definition of Done
The full authentication flow is implemented and integrated. The `User` model is created.
