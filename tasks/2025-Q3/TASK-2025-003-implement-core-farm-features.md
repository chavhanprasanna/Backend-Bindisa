## Description
The core features for managing farms and crop cycles were implemented. This provides the foundational functionality for users to represent their agricultural assets in the system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Authenticated users can perform full CRUD operations on `Farm` resources they own.
- Authenticated users can perform full CRUD operations on `CropCycle` resources, which are correctly associated with their farms.

## Definition of Done
All models, controllers, and routes for Farm and CropCycle management are implemented and tested.
