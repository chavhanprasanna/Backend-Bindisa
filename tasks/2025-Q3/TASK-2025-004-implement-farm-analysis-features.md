## Description
Implemented features to provide analytical insights to farmers. This includes a system for submitting soil test results and receiving simple, rule-based AI recommendations. A similar mock-AI system for suggesting crops was also created.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can submit soil test data for a farm and receive recommendations.
- Users can request crop suggestions based on environmental parameters.
- The "AI" logic is currently rule-based and functions as a placeholder.

## Definition of Done
All models, controllers, and routes for Soil Tests, AI Recommendations, and Crop Suggestions are implemented.
